Eight simulation files are included here. One is simulation of a hexapod missing a foreleg (5legs.ttt). The other is simulation of an intact hexapod (6legs.ttt). The rest are simulation of a hexapod with a partial regenerated foreleg with a regeneration ratio between 0.4 and 0.9.

Files are in .ttt format, which is the format for V-REP robotics simulator.
